## About
I am currently pursuing my PhD in the field of Quantum Data Management under the supervision of Dr. Rihan Hai. My research is centered around the development of novel methods to classically simulate quantum computing systems. This work is pivotal in driving forward technological advancements in quantum computing, enabling more efficient and scalable quantum simulations that can contribute to both theoretical and practical quantum computing research. Apart from this I am also investigating possible applications of quantum computing to enhance performance of data management systems and introduce new paradigms within data management.
