## About

I am a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group at TU Delft, supervised by Dr. Maria Soledad Pera. 

My research is centered on unraveling the complexities of childrenâ€™s interactions with recommender systems, aiming to understand their experiences and developing methods to ensure safe interactions within this vulnerable user group.

I obtained a BSc in Human-Computer-Interaction from the University of Hamburg and an MSc in Human-Computer-Interaction from Utrecht University.
