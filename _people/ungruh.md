## About

I am a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group at TU Delft, supervised by Dr. Maria Soledad Pera. 

My research is centered on unraveling the complexities of children’s interactions with recommender systems, aiming to understand their experiences and developing methods to ensure safe interactions within this vulnerable user group.

I obtained a BSc in Human-Computer-Interaction from the University of Hamburg and an MSc in Human-Computer-Interaction from Utrecht University.
