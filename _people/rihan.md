## About

I am a postdoc researcher at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). Before joining TU Delft, I received my Ph.D. degree from computer science 5 (Information Systems) of RWTH Aachen University. I received my master degree in June 2012 from the School of Information, Tsinghua University. Later I have joined SAP as a technical consultant. My research focuses on data integration and related dataset discovery in large-scale data lakes.
