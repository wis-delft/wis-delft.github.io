## About
I am a PhD candidate as of November 2019, Jointly working at TU Delft and ING AI for Fintech Research Lab in the track of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval under the supervision of Professor Arie van Deursen and Dr. Claudia Hauff. My research specifically focused on improving Natural Language Interfaces to Database (NLIDB), also known as Text2SQL. 

I obtained a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Amsterdam and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Jaap Kamps. I also have a BSc degree in Information Technology Engineering from the University of Tehran.
