## About

I am an Associate Professor at the Web Information Systems group of EEMCS/EWI at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Information Retrieval is my main area of expertise, and I am particularly interested in how it relates to user groups typically underserved. My current research works focus on understanding the limitations and designing algorithmic support so that search and recommender systems can more effectively serve children in different contexts (such as the classroom).

Prior to joining TU Delft, I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Brigham Young University in 2014. I then joined the Computer Science Department at Boise State University where I served as co-director of the [People and Information Research Team (Piret)](http://piret.info/) and was a co-PI in the ongoing NSF-funded project [CAST (Child Adaptive Search Tool)](https://cast.boisestate.edu/).
