## About
Hi, I'm Juliana Silva Barbosa, a PhD candidate at TU Delft working with Jie Yang and Prof.Dr.Ir. Geert-Jan Houben on LLM-multi agents for human behavior simulation. Before starting my PhD, I worked at NYU-VIDA, where I focused on data-driven methods and applied machine learning for understanding online behavior. That experience shaped my interest in bridging computational models with real human dynamics. I enjoy interdisciplinary collaboration and building tools that connect research with practical impact.

Thanks for stopping by — I'm always open to new conversations and ideas.
