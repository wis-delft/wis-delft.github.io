## About


I am a PhD candidate at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) in the [Web Information Systems](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/) 
group. I'm working at the intersection of stream processing and serverless computing under the supervision of [Asterios Katsifodimos](http://asterios.katsifodimos.com/).


Prior to that I obtained my MSc in Computer Science at TU Delft with a thesis at [Holistic Schema Matching at Scale](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Af4ebeda3-6465-49da-813b-f1e6e0820c60) 
in collaboration with [ING Netherlands](https://www.ing.nl/particulier/english/index.html).
My first degree was a diploma (Integrated master's degree) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr/index.php?id=5397).
