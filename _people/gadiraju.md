## About

Ujwal Gadiraju is an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI), *[Delft University of Technology]*(https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). He is a Director of the [Delft AI “Design@Scale” Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/dats-lab). In addition, Ujwal co-leads the *[Kappa]*(https://ujwalgadiraju.com/kappa) research line on Crowd Computing and Human-Centered AI at the WIS group. He is a Distinguished Speaker of the ACM. Ujwal is currently serving as the Co-Editor for two Frontiers in AI journals: (1) [Human-Centered AI and Crowd Computing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19868/human-centered-ai-crowd-computing) and (2) [User Modeling and Recommendations](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/19653/user-modeling-and-recommendations). He is also the Co-Editor-in-Chief of the [Human Computation Journal](http://hcjournal.org/) and an Associate Editor of the Taylor and Francis [Behavior and Information Technology](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tbit20/current) journal.

Prior to joining the WIS group, Ujwal worked at the L3S Research Center as a Postdoctoral researcher between 2017-2020. Ujwal received a PhD degree (Dr. rer. nat.) in Computer Science from the Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany in 2017, and an MSc. Computer Science degree from TU Delft, the Netherlands in 2012. His research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Retrieval (IR), with a special focus on Crowd Computing. Ujwal’s prior work in Crowd Computing has explored methods to improve the effectiveness of the crowdsourcing paradigm, running large-scale human-centered experiments to understand the interaction between humans and machines, and understanding the societal impact of algorithmic decision-making.

Ujwal’s work focuses on systematically leveraging the ‘hybrid intelligence’ obtained by combining humans and machines to solve a range of problems in HCI and AI. 
Ujwal received the Douglas Engelbart Best Paper award at the ACM HT 2017 conference, a Best Paper Honorable Mention award at the ACM CSCW 2020 conference, 
and co-authored work that won a Best Student Paper award at AAAI HCOMP 2020.
