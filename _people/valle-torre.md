## About

My (work) interest is in the world of Data (_Engineering, Analytics and Science_) and what we can learn from it. For the past 3 years, I’ve had the privilege of doing this in TU Delft, both with the Web Information Systems (WIS) group and the Centre for Education and Learning ([CEL](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home)). Lately I’ve become more and more interested in how data can explain and improve _how we learn_, so now I’m a PhD student in the field of Learning Analytics, Self-Regulated Learning, and more! Visit my [website](https://mvallet91.github.io/) for more info.
