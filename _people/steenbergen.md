## About
I am a PhD candidate at WIS at Delft University of Technology. My research focuses on improving the teamwork skills of Computer Science students. With this, I am combining my own experiences as a student in computer science with my interest in education. This can be tricky to do, since my education was fully focused on computer science without any formal education onâ€¦ Education!

I am quite familiar with Delft and its university, as I've completed both my BSc and MSc here. In the year in between those degrees, I was the commissioner of computer science education for the study association of computer science and mathematics at TU Delft, where I was responsible for collecting feedback about the courses and organizing events. I've also completed a minor in education, giving me a teaching qualification for high schools in the Netherlands. During my master's degree, I worked on the Co-Teach Informatica project, allowing high schools in the Netherlands to provide computer science as a course, even if they could not find a qualified teacher.
