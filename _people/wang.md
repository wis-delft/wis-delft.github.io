## About
I am a post-doc in the Web Information Systems (WIS) group at TU Delft, the Netherlands. I am working on the 6G-DALI project, under supervision of Rihan Hai. Before joining TU Delft, I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science in 2025 from the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the Netherlands. During my PhD journey, I also worked as a Marie-Curie fellow funded by the CLARIFY project (Grant agreement No. 860627). I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Chongqing University, China, in 2019 and 2016, respectively. My research interests include Virtual Research Environment (VRE), collaborative learning, workflow management for decentralised artificial intelligence, and data space.
