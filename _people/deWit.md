## About
Shirley joined LDE CEL in February 2023 to continue her research on women in Computer Science. With her double master's degree in both Computer Science and Science Communication, she likes to combine her technical knowledge and skills with social sciences. During her first years of her PhD, funded by VHTO which is the Dutch expert centre on gender diversity in STEM, she researched the stereotypical images children hold about programmers. At LDE CEL, she will contain this line of work and focus on gender inclusiveness in programming education for children. With her research, we hope to contribute to closing the gender gap in Computer Science.
