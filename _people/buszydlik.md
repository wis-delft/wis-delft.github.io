## About
Hello! My name is Aleksander, and I am a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group, working under the supervision of Dr. Gosia Migut.

My project is part of the TU Delft Teaching Academy Initiative on Innovation in Delft Engineering Education (IDEE). I study how modern AI technologies, such as large language models, are reshaping the way we teach and learn at technical universities. Although you can find me in the computer science building, the project extends far beyond computer science education. My goal is to provide an understanding of AI innovations that is useful and relevant for students, teachers, and administrators from all TU Delft programmes. Among other things, that means I look at how AI can help students reach their learning goals, and how we can make sure it does not get in the way of authentic, meaningful learning.

I come from a technical background, having earned both my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at TU Delft. During my master's, I realised that I am most passionate about studying socio-technical information systems, drawing insights from a variety of disciplines. I consider myself a very applied researcher: I enjoy working on practical, impactful, and societally relevant challenges. Over the years, I have worn many hats at TU Delft, from head teaching assistant to student representative, which makes me especially excited to look at the opportunities and challenges that AI introduces into education in my PhD project.
