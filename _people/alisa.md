## About
I am a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group and an Early Stage Researcher in the \[NL4XAI\](https://nl4xai.eu/) project under supervision of  Nava Tintarev.
Before coming to TU Delft, I obtained my BSc and MSc degree in cognitive science and human-machine interaction from Chemnitz University of Technology. 
Currently, my research is focused on understanding how to mitigate cognitive biases during interactions with search results and recommendations, for example by applying explanations to guide user behavior.
