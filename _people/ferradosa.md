## About
Hi! I’m Eva, and I’m a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group at TU Delft, under the supervision of Dr. Christoph Lofi. Here, I study how to improve metadata management workflows to support more effective data sharing and collaboration in scientific research. My work focuses on using AI tools to capture and document the valuable contextual knowledge that often emerges during informal conversations between researchers about their data. This knowledge is typically left undocumented, but is essential for making data reusable and meaningful across disciplines.

My research is being conducted within the CropXR consortium, a collaborative initiative focused on building crop resilience to climate change through interdisciplinary science. In a field as vital as food security, I see open and equitable data sharing not only as a technical challenge, but as a shared responsibility. When knowledge has the potential to strengthen our food systems and support communities worldwide, it should be treated as a common good. Enabling collaboration through better data practices is, to me, a meaningful way to contribute to a more resilient and just future.
 
I come from a background in Biomedical Engineering (BSc) and Biochemical Engineering (MSc), with a minor in Humanitarian Engineering. During my studies, I was especially drawn to the theoretical side of biology, which I explored through computational modelling while collaborating closely with colleagues working in the wet lab. Over time, I found myself naturally stepping into the role of mediator, translating between experimental and computational perspectives. I’ve come to really value and thrive in this bridging role, and it’s what motivates me in my current work: helping researchers from diverse backgrounds connect, share their knowledge, and collaborate.
