## About
I am a PhD Candidate at the Web Information Systems group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at Delft University of Technology. I am also part of the AI for Fintech Research, a collaboration between ING and Delft University of Technology. I am supervised by Asterios Katsifodimos. My research is focused on Data Integration on Massive Data Streams, and specifically Streaming Similarity Joins for Data Integration.

I hold a 5-year Diploma (equivalent to M.Eng.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from National Technical University of Athens. In my thesis, I worked on query rewriting for Data Integration.
