## About
I am an Assistant Professor in the AI & Computing Education Research team, which is part of the Web Information Systems group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI) at Delft University of Technology. 

My research focuses on strengthening ML/AI education for engineering students and understanding where and how AI tools can be used meaningfully and responsibly in educational settings.  
I have obtained my phd in the area of Explainable Machine Learning from the University of Amsterdam.

I teach courses on Machine Learning and AI in Education and actively work on strengthening the [Machine Learning & AI Teachers Community] (https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/onderwijs/ai-onderwijsinnovatie/machine-learning-teachers-community) within and outside TU Delft. 

I also love making jewellery. Some examples of my jewels can be found on my [personal website](https://gosiamigut.github.io).
