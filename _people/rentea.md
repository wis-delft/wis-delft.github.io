## About

I am a PhD candidate at Delft University of Technology (Web Information Systems). My research focuses on mathematics prerequisite knowledge in machine learning education, examining the links between math and ML in university courses, the effects of math preparedness on student learning, and evidence-based solutions to better support learners. Drawing on learning theories, my work includes problem analysis, intervention design, and empirical evaluation in classroom settings.

I earned my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at TU Delft. Throughout my studies, I was a teaching assistant for multiple courses, an experience that strengthened my long-standing interest in education and inspired my MSc thesis on ML education. That trajectory naturally led to my PhD, where I aim to help students reach their ML learning goals with clearer pathways from foundational mathematics to practical machine learning.
