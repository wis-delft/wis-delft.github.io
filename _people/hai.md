## About

I am an assistant professor in the Web Information Systems (WIS) group at TU Delft, Netherlands. Before joining TU Delft, I received my Ph.D. degree from computer science 5 (Information Systems) of RWTH Aachen University. I received my master degree in June 2012 from the School of Information, Tsinghua University. My research focuses on data lakes, data management for machine learning, and quantum data management.
