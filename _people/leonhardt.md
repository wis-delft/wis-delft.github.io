## About
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Web Information Systems group at TU Delft.

I was a PhD student at [L3S Research Center](https://l3s.de/), [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/), Germany, under [Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl](https://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/) and [Prof. Avishek Anand](https://www.avishekanand.com/).

I mainly work on information retrieval. Specifically, my current focus lies on efficiency of neural ranking models. Less prominently, I work on effectiveness and interpretability (by design) for ranking and retrieval.
