## About
I am an Assistant Professor at the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) (WIS) group in [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). I co-lead the "kappa" research line on Human-Centered AI and Crowd Computing at the WIS group and the Delft AI Lab “Design@Scale” in the university. Before, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science), based in Seattle, and a Senior Researcher at the [eXascale Infolab](https://exascale.info), University of Fribourg - Switzerland. I received my Ph.D. from TU Delft in 2017, M.Sc. from TU Eindhoven in 2013, and B.Eng. from Zhejiang University in 2011. During my M.Sc., I also spent some time at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/home).

I am interested in developing human-in-the-loop methods and tools for building reliable and trustworthy machine learning systems. I am passionate about making AI more “knowledgeable” and consider humans as an essential means to understanding the knowns and unknowns of intelligent machines, through human interpretation of machine behavior and human creation of knowledge. I also consider computational algorithms as essential tools to assist humans in knowledge reasoning at scale, under uncertainty. My research methodology is therefore both empirical and theoretical, with primary activities characterized by the design, implementation, and analysis of human studies, computational algorithms, and human-in-the-loop systems.
