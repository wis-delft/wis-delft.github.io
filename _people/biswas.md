## About
I am a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group at TU Delft, supervised by Ujwal Gadiraju. I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science (Data Science track) at TU Delft. Between my master's and PhD, I co-founded a startup called Qaring. Prior to my master's degree, I held various roles in the software development industry.

Interdisciplinarity is central to my research methodology. I enjoy exploring domains such as Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience to identify isomorphic patterns, which I then strive to integrate into Computer Science.

My current research focuses on Generative AI in the context of Human-Computer Interaction.
