## About
Hrishita Chakrabarti is a PhD candidate in the [Web Information Systems](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group at TU Delft with [Dr. Maria Soledad Pera](https://solepera.github.io/) as her supervisor. She received her B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT Vellore and her MSc in Computer Science from TU Delft. For her master's thesis, [“Much ado about Accessibility”](https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:51442134-01c0-4e01-9ff3-6f7bbafdac14), she empirically explored the accessibility of responses of popular online information-seeking tools to autistic users. 

As a part of the [“Scaffolding to foster independence when children search Online for Learning” (SOL)](https://solandchildren.wordpress.com/) project, her current research investigates the scaffolding needed in online search tools to improve search literacy skills in children as they search for information in a classroom setting.
