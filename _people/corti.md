## About
I am a PhD Candidate in the [Web Information Systems (WIS)](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) group at TU Delft. There, I am supervised by Dr. [Jie Yang](https://yangjiera.github.io/) and Prof.Dr.Ir. [Geert-Jan Houben](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/houben).
I am also part of the TU Delft AI Lab [Design@Scale](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/design-at-scale-lab).
In my work, I adopt a human-centred approach to studying and building tools that support practitioners in diagnosing the behaviours of large multimodal and language models.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) where I contributed to two EU H2020 projects, [TRIGGER](https://trigger-project.eu/) and [PERISCOPE](https://periscopeproject.eu/).
I received my MSc (supervised by Prof. [Marco Brambilla](https://marco-brambilla.com/)) and BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano in 2019 and 2017 respectively.
