## About

I am a PhD candidate at the Web Information Systems group at Delft University of Technology under supervision of Ujwal Gadiraju. My promotor is Willem-Paul Brinkman and my co-promotors are Ujwal Gadiraju and Olya Kudina.  

My research revolves around Human-AI decision-making, with a specific focus on the field of adolescent mental well-being. My research is part of the ProtectMe project, which is a collaborative effort between TU Delft, Erasmus MC, and Erasmus University. The project's aim is to use technology to prevent mental health problems among adolescents.

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained a bachelor in Psychobiology and a master in Information Studies with a specialization in Data Science from the University of Amsterdam. During my master thesis, I studied the impact of a crisis event on social media virality prediction on Twitter. Next to my master, I got the oppurtunity to work as a lab manager at the [*Connected Minds Lab*](https://connectedmindslab.net) within the Developmental Psychology department at the University of Amsterdam. This role allowed me to explore social learning and decision-making in humans, using survey, behavioral, and neuroimaging methods.
