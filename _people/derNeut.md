## About

I work on the AI value-alignment problem from the perspective of professional practice in Dutch Government. I do this under the supervision of Ujwal Gadiraju (WIS) and Stefan Buijsman (Digital Ethics).

My aim with the project is to develop the professional practice perspective on AI value-alignment and contribute to responsible practice when it comes to model usage in the Dutch government.

I graduated from public administration and philosophy of science & technology on the topic of responsible practice when using machine learning models in executive government. I conceptualized what it means to responsibly use machine learning models in executive government and conducted a material-discursive case study on the use of the risk classification model by the Dutch tax authorities at the time that the social benefit scandal manifested.
