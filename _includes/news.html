        The first generation of experts on Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Europe is about to arise as the <a href="https://nl4xai.eu/">NL4XAI</a> research project comes to an end. Funded under the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme to train eleven PhD candidates, this European consortium announces its final conference and industrial event on 24 May 2024 at the DesignLab of the University of Twente, The Netherlands (<a href="https://nl4xai.eu/event/nl4xai-final-conference/">Shaping the Future of AI – NL4XAI – Interactive Natural Language Technology for Explainable Artificial Intelligence</a>). This event is meant as a platform to share the groundbreaking results achieved by the PhD candidates in NLP and XAI, and  catalyze dynamic discussions.
